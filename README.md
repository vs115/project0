I created a website on the topic **"Indian Armed Forces"**. It has 4 HTML pages which are all interlinked. The **4 HTML pages are: HOME, ARMY, NAVY, and AIR FORCE**. Every HTML page has 1 **table** and 1 **list**. Ever webpage has 4 to 5 sections which are linked through a side navigation bar. Every section has 1 head **image and tables have many images**.

CSS and SCSS have been used to design the web page. I have used **.class, #id, :hover, #sbimg img, and ',' selectors** in CSS. In SCSS **color variable, nesting & inheritence** have been used .

Also I have added Bootstrap ***BUTTON* component** for internal navigation and many **BOOTSTRAP GRID MODELS** nested within each other in the website design.

**Media query** is applied to all elements and entire website is mobile responsive.
